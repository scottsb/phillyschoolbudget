This project is an interactive visualization of the Philadelphia School Budget, comparing funding with expenses.

## Target Audience
This application is targeted to anybody with an interest in the recurring school budget crisis. Theoretically this should include any resident of Philly, since primary and secondary education are essential the future of our city, but it will be of greatest value to parents (prospective and current) and educators.

## Future Plans
Features on the roadmap for the near future:
* **Scenarios:** Allow users to "crowd source" solutions, adjusting funding sources or expense categories, and then share that solution via a short link or social media.
* **Year-to-year comparisons:** Compare data between years, visually showing the changes.

Good ideas that are less likely or further future: 
* **Comparisons:** Comparisons of the Philly budget with suburban districts and/or other cities.
* **Enrollment:** Maps of where public school enrollment is shifting:
  * In comparison to charter school locations.
  * From school year to school year, in comparison with closing schools.
